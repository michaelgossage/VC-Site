is built on the idea of a life lived as a vacation â€“ experiencing and finding new things, meeting new people, waking up and 
doing what you like and liking what you do. The items mix photography and art-inspired 
practices with contemporary, functional and relaxed design. With a focus on striving to perfect a stlye 
through learning and continual growth. Aiming to push sustainability and reusability in the long term to 
benefit the environment and make every item more meaningful than the sum of its parts.</p>
